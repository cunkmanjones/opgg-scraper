> [!CAUTION]
> July 12th, 2025: Scraper no longer functions properly due to API obfuscation by OP.GG.
> Unless a new entry point is found, the current version of the application (1.0) will throw an HTTPS Connection error pointing towards 'lol-web-api.op.gg'.
> It's still possible for anyone to scrape data from OP.GG, however, it would be without the use of their API, which for this app would require a full rebuild of the core functionality.

# Why
*This project isn't to be taken seriously; I just made it for fun.*<br/>
I wanted to make a small application in Python with a nice-looking GUI. I also wanted to create a GitHub repository and see how difficult it would be to maintain it. The coding isn't clean or well documented, there's a massive gap in between commits due to overhauling the entire backend, and I learned more and more as the project went on, so a lot of the formatting evolved over time. The project itself isn't technically a scraper anymore, but I'm committed to the name.
